My solutions to: 
[MIT OCW 6s096 - Effective Programing in C and C++](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-s096-effective-programming-in-c-and-c-january-iap-2014)
.

I worked through these to get back up to speed in C and C++. 
I also experimented with [Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity)
for unit testing targeting embededd systems.
